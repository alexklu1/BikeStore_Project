# Bike Sales Project

## Bike Sales Excel Project

In this Excel data analysis project, I delved into a comprehensive sales data of a bike company to extract valuable insights that would aid in making informed business decisions. By utilising Microsoft Excel, I conducted a detailed examination of the dataset, focusing on crucial factors that impact the company's sales performance. The main objectives were to determine the average income of buyers per purchase, analyse the commute distance per buyer, explore the relationship between customer age and purchase behavior, and assess the influence of customers' marital status, educational background, and region of residence on their purchasing decisions.

### Project Objectives:

Average Income of Buyers per Purchase: I aimed to calculate the average income of the bike company's customers for each purchase. This analysis provided valuable information about the purchasing power and economic background of the clientele, facilitating targeted marketing strategies.

Commute Distance per Buyer: By analysing the commute distance data, I sought to understand how far the customers were willing to travel to purchase bikes. This analysis shed light on the company's regional reach and helped identify potential areas for expansion or targeted marketing efforts.

Customer Age vs. Purchase Behavior: The exploration of the relationship between customer age and their purchase behavior allowed me to identify patterns in buying preferences across different age groups. This valuable insight can be used to tailor product offerings and marketing campaigns to better resonate with specific customer demographics.

Impact of Marital Status, Educational Background, and Region on Purchase Decisions: I investigated whether customers' marital status, educational background, and the region they lived in played a role in their purchasing decisions. This analysis offered a deeper understanding of the customer's preferences and needs, enabling the Bike company to customise their offerings and marketing messages accordingly.
